IBD Project: Pharmaceutical Data Analysis and Visualization
This project focused on analyzing and visualizing a pharmaceutical dataset from Drug Bank. ]The core tasks involved systematic data preprocessing, including handling missing values, removing duplicate entries, and standardizing data types to create a clean and structured dataset. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to identify patterns and trends, with numerical attributes (e.g., substitute counts, side effects) analyzed using histograms, and correlations explored with scatter plots and heatmaps. [cite_start]Various visualization techniques, such as bar graphs, pie charts, word clouds, and heatmaps, were utilized to illustrate the distribution of therapeutic and chemical classes, common side effects, and habit-forming drugs, providing insights into drug properties and substitutes. An interactive querying feature was also implemented for retrieving specific drug details.

AI/ML Project: Work From Anywhere Salary Prediction & Classification
This project involved a comprehensive analysis of remote job salary data using machine learning. It integrated supervised learning methods like classification (predicting salary tiers such as Low, Medium, High using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM) and regression (predicting continuous salary values with Linear Regression) Unsupervised learning approaches such as KMeans and Hierarchical Clustering were applied to discover latent groupings among companies based on employee satisfaction and job roles. Key activities included data preprocessing (handling duplicates, missing values, outlier analysis, categorical encoding, feature scaling) , exploratory data analysis (correlation heatmaps, distribution analysis) , evaluating model performance with metrics like RÂ² score and analyzing confusion matrices , and hyperparameter optimization for the Random Forest model
